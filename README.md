## Task

**Using Tableau aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story or report. The following are some questions you will need to tackle.**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
   * 5,029,334 total combined rides in July 2016, 2017, and 2018

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?
  * Ridership has grown for the month of July year over year from 2017 to 2018 by 7.07% and from 2018 to 2019 by 3.54%

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
  * While short-term customer ridership has grown minimally (July 2017 to 2018 by 1.19% and July 2018 to 2019 by 0.46%), annual subscribers have grown by 5.88% from July 2017 to July 2019 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used?
  * Peak hours were 8:00am and 5:00pm/6:00pm, correlating with morning and evening rush hours

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

  * Pershing Square North
  * West St & Chambers St
  * 12th Ave & W. 40th St
  * E 17th St & Broadway
  * W 21st St & 6th Ave
  * Broadway & E 22nd St
  * W 20th St & 11th Ave
  * Central Park S & 6th Ave
  * Broadway & E 14th St
  * South End Ave & Liberty St.

  It's likely these are the top 10 because they're near major transportation hubs (subway stations) and popular bike routes

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

  * Pershing Square North
  * West St & Chambers St
  * 12th Ave & W. 40th St
  * E 17th St & Broadway
  * W 21st St & 6th Ave
  * Broadway & E 22nd St
  * W 20th St & 11th Ave
  * Carmine St & 6th Ave
  * South End Ave & Liberty St
  * Broadway & E 14th St

  The top 10 end vs. start stations are the same with the exception of Carmine St & 6th Ave and Central Park S & 6th Ave. 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why)

  * 11th St & 35th Ave
  * 11th St & 43rd Ave
  * 21st St & 36 Ave
  * 21st St & 38 Ave
  * 27th Ave & 4th St
  * 34th Ave & 13th St
  * 40th Ave & 9th St
  * NYCBS Depot – STY – Garage 4
  * Sullivan Pl & Bedford Ave

  The bottom 10 stations for starting a journey are either at MTA bus stations and outside of Manhattan, which has the largest concentration of bike stations

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

  * 11th St & 35th Ave
  * 11th St & 43rd Ave
  * 21st St & 36 Ave
  * 21st St & 38 Ave
  * 27th Ave & 4th St
  * 40th Ave & 9th St
  * NYCBS Depot – Delancey
  * NYCBS Depot – STY – Garage 4
  * Sullivan Pl & Bedford Ave

  The bottom 10 stations for ending a journey are also similar to the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

  * As of July 2018 there are:
    66.07% Male
    24.94% Female
    8.99% Unknown

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
  * Female ridership has increased year over year but male ridership still far outpaces all genders

* How does the average trip duration change by age?
  * In 2017 the average trip durations was relatively steady per age, with noticeable differences for 21-22, 25, 33, and 75 year olds
  * In 2018 the 3 ages with the longest trip duration were 19, 43, and 52
  * In 2019 the 3 ages with the longest trip duration were 17, 22, and 67

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
  * There are 12 bikes that are have been ridden over 1,000 hours and 4 bikes that have surpassed over 1,600 hours. These 16 bikes are at the highest risk of needing repair or inspection.
